OpenDelta Server Software
=========================

Software to create needed files for OpenDelta modified to get installed and used easily.

Installation
============

Before you can use the software the first time run ./install.sh. Change FILE_MATCH=CARBON-KK-Myself5-*.zip in opendelta.sh to your roms basename. (See my configuration)

Usage
=====

To create the needed files place your 2nd newest Rom file in the folder old and your newest in the folder new. Then run ./opendelta.sh *YOUR DEVICE*. When the script finished it's work upload the contents of the folder publish.

Credits

This software, as also the app OpenDelta (where OpenDelta is based on), has been created by Chainfire. I just modified it to make it easy to use for everyone.
