CarbonDelta Server Software

Software to create needed files for OpenDelta modified to get installed and used easily.

Installation

Before you can use the software the first time run ./install.sh. Change FILE_MATCH=CARBON-KK-Myself5-*.zip in carbondelta.sh to your roms basename. (See my configuration)
